    "We can solve this by computing rand5() twice. This gives us more than 7 options to choose from. However, we must be careful not to take the sum or product of the results -- this can skew the probability distribution. Consider that there's only one way to make 2 from two rand5s but two ways to make 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we must consider each distinct pair of rand5() results. This gives us 5^2 = 25 different ways to pick from, each uniformly distributed. Ideally, we would divide these by 7, but no power of 5 is also a multiple of 7 (consider the prime factorization of 5^N), so we will have to make do. For our solution, we'll make a table of results:\n",
